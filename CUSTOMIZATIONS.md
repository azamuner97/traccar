# Project customizations

This fork is based on Traccar 6.15.3 and pins the matching customized web app
through the `traccar-web` Git submodule. A server commit therefore identifies
the exact server and web source pair used for a build.

## Participant role markers

The Traccar Tool writes role-marker metadata into standard Traccar device
attributes for real and mirrored game participants:

```text
device.category = "person"
device.attributes.traccarToolRole = "player" | "supporter" | "hunter"
device.attributes.traccarToolRoleNumber = positive integer
device.attributes.traccarToolMirror = true    # mirrored devices only
```

The web app renders the role background and participant number on map markers
and in the device sidebar. The number is rendered as text, so it is not limited
to a fixed set of image assets. Missing or invalid role metadata uses the normal
Traccar category marker. Numeric device categories are not a compatibility
source for role numbers.

Traccar already persists arbitrary device attributes through its existing
device model and API. No Java model field, database migration, or dedicated
role endpoint is required for this feature. The Tool owns reconciliation of the
three managed values and preserves unrelated attributes.

## Build contract

The release workflow checks out this repository with submodules and builds
`traccar-web/` at the commit recorded by the server repository. It must not
select a separate web revision by a release tag. Project-branch CI runs the web
role-marker tests, lint, and production build in addition to the server build.

When changing the web app:

1. Commit and push the web change first.
2. Update and commit the `traccar-web` submodule pointer in this repository.
3. Build the combined server release from that server commit.

## Rollout order

1. Deploy the combined server and web build.
2. Release the matching Traccar Tool.
3. Run Device Setup once for every existing session.
4. Confirm managed devices have category `person`, integer
   `traccarToolRoleNumber`, and the expected `traccarToolRole` while retaining
   unrelated attributes.

There is intentionally no legacy numeric-category fallback because this project
has not entered production. Keep the legacy `Traccar-Server` repository as a
read-only migration reference until the combined release has been verified.

If game-session state later moves into the server, introduce a dedicated
`GameSessionParticipant` entity and API as a separate migration. That future
model can become authoritative for assignments; role-marker presentation alone
does not justify adding it now.
