# Project customizations

This fork is based on Traccar 6.15.3 and pins the matching customized web app
through the `traccar-web` Git submodule. A server commit therefore identifies
the exact server and web source pair used for a build.

## Participant role markers

The Traccar Tool writes role-marker metadata into standard Traccar device
attributes for real and mirrored game participants:

```text
device.category = "person"
device.attributes.traccarToolRole = "player" | "supporter" | "hunter"
device.attributes.traccarToolRoleNumber = positive integer
device.attributes.traccarToolMirror = true    # mirrored devices only
```

The web app renders the role background and participant number on map markers
and in the device sidebar. The number is rendered as text, so it is not limited
to a fixed set of image assets. Missing or invalid role metadata uses the normal
Traccar category marker. Numeric device categories are not a compatibility
source for role numbers.

Traccar already persists arbitrary device attributes through its existing
device model and API. No Java model field, database migration, or dedicated
role endpoint is required for this feature. The Tool owns reconciliation of the
three managed values and preserves unrelated attributes.

## Build contract

The release workflow checks out this repository with submodules and builds
`traccar-web/` at the commit recorded by the server repository. It must not
select a separate web revision by a release tag. Project-branch CI runs the web
role-marker tests, lint, and production build in addition to the server build.

When changing the web app:

1. Commit and push the web change first.
2. Update and commit the `traccar-web` submodule pointer in this repository.
3. Build the combined server release from that server commit.

## Local development environment

The repository includes `compose.yml` for a persistent local MySQL database and
an optional full-stack integration build. The database matches the deployed
MySQL 8.4.8 version, character set, JDBC options, and InnoDB configuration. It
uses local development credentials and named volumes; it does not contain or
copy production passwords or data.

Install Homebrew `openjdk@21` and `node@22` (Temurin 21 is also compatible).
Select the project versions for the current terminal with:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk@21)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$(brew --prefix node@22)/bin:$PATH"
```

### Fast server and web development

Start MySQL in Docker:

```shell
docker compose up -d --wait database
```

Optional `TRACCAR_DB_PASSWORD` and `TRACCAR_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` overrides must be
set before the named database volume is first created and then kept stable.

Build and run Traccar locally so Java debugging and rebuilds stay fast:

```shell
./gradlew assemble --no-daemon --stacktrace
CONFIG_USE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES=true \
DATABASE_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver \
DATABASE_URL="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3307/traccar?zeroDateTimeBehavior=round&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false&allowMultiQueries=true&autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8&sessionVariables=sql_mode=''" \
DATABASE_USER=traccar \
DATABASE_PASSWORD="${TRACCAR_DB_PASSWORD:-traccar-dev}" \
"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -jar target/tracker-server.jar debug.xml
```

In another terminal, start the web app:

```shell
cd traccar-web
npm ci
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Configure Traccar Tool with server URL
`http://localhost:8082` and client URL `http://localhost:5055`.

### Full Docker integration test

Build and run the combined customized server and web app:

```shell
docker compose --profile full up -d --build --wait
```

Open `http://localhost:8083`. Configure Traccar Tool with server URL
`http://localhost:8083` and client URL `http://localhost:5056`. Stop the stack
without deleting its named database and log volumes:

```shell
docker compose --profile full down
```

Do not add `-v` to the shutdown command unless the local database is
intentionally being reset. See `AGENTS.md` for the complete verification and
repository-safety contract.

## Rollout order

1. Deploy the combined server and web build.
2. Release the matching Traccar Tool.
3. Run Device Setup once for every existing session.
4. Confirm managed devices have category `person`, integer
   `traccarToolRoleNumber`, and the expected `traccarToolRole` while retaining
   unrelated attributes.

There is intentionally no legacy numeric-category fallback because this project
has not entered production. Keep the legacy `Traccar-Server` repository as a
read-only migration reference until the combined release has been verified.

If game-session state later moves into the server, introduce a dedicated
`GameSessionParticipant` entity and API as a separate migration. That future
model can become authoritative for assignments; role-marker presentation alone
does not justify adding it now.
